# TpuGraphs: A Performance Prediction Dataset on Large Tensor Computational Graphs

TpuGraphs is a performance prediction dataset on full tensor programs, represented as computational graphs, running on Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Each graph in the dataset represents the main computation of a machine learning workload, e.g., a training epoch or an inference step. Each data sample contains a computational graph, a compilation configuration, and the execution time of the graph when compiled with the configuration. The graphs in the dataset are collected from open-source machine learning programs, featuring popular model architectures (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet, Mask R-CNN, and Transformer).

Please refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13490) for more details about the importance and challenges of the dataset, how the dataset is generated, the model baselines, and the experimental results. If you find this dataset useful in your research, please cite our paper as:

## Dataset

The dataset consists of two compiler optimization collections: *layout* and *tile*.
Layout configurations control how tensors are laid out in the physical memory, by specifying
the dimension order of each input and output of an operation node. A tile configuration controls
the tile size of each fused subgraph.

The dataset is located at http://download.tensorflow.org/data/tpu_graphs/v0.
You can use `wget` or `curl` command to download files.

To download all files, please follow **one** of these options:

  1. Download http://download.tensorflow.org/data/tpu_graphs/v0/npz_all.tar, preferably, to `~/data/tpugraphs` (as our training pipelines read from there),
  then untar as `tar xvf npz_all.tar`. This can be done with bash commands:

  ```
  mkdir -p ~/data/tpugraphs
  cd ~/data/tpugraphs
  curl http://download.tensorflow.org/data/tpu_graphs/v0/npz_all.tar > npz_all.tar
  tar xvf npz_all.tar
  ```

  2. Download from
  [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-ai-model-runtime/data).

  3. Use our helper script `echo_download_command.py`.
  From a clone of this directory:

  ```sh
  python3 echo_download_commands.py | bash
  ```

  Removing the last pipe (`| bash`) shows the commands for downloading the dataset
  (a few `curl` commands followed by `tar xvf`).

  To download {train, test, validation} data for layout collection, e.g.,
  for `layout:xla:random`, run:

  ```sh
  mkdir -p ~/data/tpugraphs
  cd ~/data/tpugraphs

## Running Baseline Models

This repo hosts two training pipelines: `tiles_train.py` and `layout_train.py`,
respectively, for training models on the collections `tile:xla` and
`layout:{nlp|xla}:{random|default}`. Both scripts train for some epochs then
infer predictions on the test set. By default, the trained models are saved and
alongside a `csv` file containing inference on the test set.

To combine all five inference files into one CSV to submit to our
[Kaggle competition](https://kaggle.com/competitions/predict-ai-model-runtime),
run:

```sh
python combine_csvs.py
```

NOTE: The above command will look for files produced by `tiles_train.py` and
`layout_train.py`


#### Python environment setup with Conda

```sh
conda create -n tpugraphs python=3.10
conda activate tpugraphs

conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow
conda install -c conda-forge tqdm

pip install tensorflow_gnn --pre
pip install tensorflow-ranking
conda clean --all
```

For subsequent runs, simply activate the same environment with `conda activate tpugraphs`.


### Model on `tile:xla` collection

#### Train model

The following command will train a GraphSAGE model with the early join of config features on a small subset of data:
```
python tiles_train.py --model=EarlyJoinSAGE --toy_data=True
```

To train on the full dataset, run:
```
python tiles_train.py --model=EarlyJoinSAGE
```

The current code supports training on a CPU.
Once the training is done, it will produce a jsonz file with the prefix "run_".
This file will contain the overall top-K errors (see the definition in the paper)
on kernels in the validation set. To view the result:
```
zcat run_xxx.jsonz > run_xxx.json
```

Search for:
```
"final_error": {"val": {"1": <top-1 error>, "5": <top-5 error>, "10": <top-10 error>}}
```
where 0.2 error means 20% error.

Further, the training code will output a `.csv` file containing top-5 rankings
of configurations over test set. By default, the csv will be written to:
```
~/out/tpugraphs_tiles/results_<timestamp>.csv
```
The path can be overridden with flags `--out_dir` and `--results_csv`. Please
refer to
[train_args.py](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/tpu_graphs/blob/main/tpu_graphs/baselines/tiles/train_args.py)
for a list of flags.

#### Sweep hyperparameters

Run Apache Beam locally (for debugging):
```
python tiles_beam_experiments.py --debug
```

To run the pipeline on Google Cloud, please follow [this instruction](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/quickstarts/create-pipeline-python).


#### Evaluate model

To evaluate models trained on the `tile` collection, look for the model
directory (the training pipeline defaults flag `--out_dir` to
`~/out/tpugraphs_tiles`) which should start with prefix `model_`.
To evaluate model(s), run:
```
python tiles_evaluate.py --dirs <comma-separated list of model dirs>
```

This script will print out per-program top-K errors for kernels in the validation set in the following format:
```
{
  "K": {  # top-K error
    <program> : <error>,
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

Currently, the evaluation script does not produce the ranking `.csv` file.


### Model on `layout:{xla|nlp}:{random|default}` collections

We provide baseline for the layout collections in this repo.
You can train the layout baseline model by invoking:

```sh
# As a test.
python layout_train.py --epochs 10 --toy_data=True

# On xla:random
python layout_train.py --source xla --search random --epochs 10 --max_configs 1000

# On xla:default
python layout_train.py --source xla --search default --epochs 10 --max_configs 1000

# On nlp:random
python layout_train.py --source nlp --search random --epochs 10 --max_configs 1000

# On nlp:default
python layout_train.py --source nlp --search default --epochs 10 --max_configs 1000
```

NOTE: For training on the NLP collections, since the data is large, our trainer
script cannot fit the data into memory. The flag `--max_configs 1000` allows us
to run. It samples only this many configurations per graph. However, you may
write your own scalable implementation, or modify ours.

For an alternative implementation (that uses PyTorch), you may view our
collaborators' Graph Segmented Training implementation (GST) at
https://github.com/kaidic/GST.


Each (complete) invocation of `python layout_train.py` should train the model,
followed by inference on the test set. The inference step produces a ranking
`.csv` file, by default at:
```
~/out/tpugraphs_layout/results_<timestamp>_<source>_<search>.csv
```
Example: `~/out/tpugraphs_layout/results_1693169615975_xla_default.csv`.

NOTE: You can run `python combine_csvs.py` to produces the final CSV that can
be submitted to our
[Kaggle competition](https://kaggle.com/competitions/predict-ai-model-runtime).
The tool requires 5 input CSV files
corresponding to  collections `tile:xla`, `layout:xla:default`,
`layout:xla:random`, `layout:nlp:default`, `layout:nlp:random`. You may
specify them as flag arguments. By default, `combine_csvs.py` will choose the
most-recent timestamp files, searching in the default directories produced by
the training pipelines (i.e. `~/out/tpugraphs_layout` for `layout_train.py`, and
`~/out/tpugraphs_tiles/` for `tiles_train.py`).


#### Evaluate model

To evaluate models on the validation set of layout collections, please refer to
[tpu_graphs/evals](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/tpu_graphs/tree/main/tpu_graphs/evals).


## Dataset File Description

### Tiles Collection `.npz` files

We provide our dataset as `.npz` files. Download instructions are in Section
"Copy dataset files".

Suppose a `.npz` file stores a graph (representing a kernel) with `n` nodes and
`m` edges. In addition, suppose we compile the graph with `c` different
configurations, and run each on a TPU. **Crucially, the configuration is at the
graph-level**. Then, the `.npz` file stores the following dictionary (can be
loaded with `d = dict(np.load("npz/tile/xla/train/<pick 1>.npz"))`):

  * Key `"node_feat"`: contains `float32` matrix with shape `(n, 140)`. The
    `u`th row contains the feature vector for node `u < n` (please see
    Subsection "Node Features", below).
    Nodes are ordered topologically.
  * Key `"node_opcode"` contains `int32` vector with shape `(n, )`. The `u`th
    entry stores the op-code for node `u` (please see the mapping of opcode to
    instruction name
    [here](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/tpu_graphs/blob/main/tpu_graphs/process_data/xla/hlo_opcode.h#L94)).
  * Key `"edge_index"` contains `int32` matrix with shape `(m, 2)`. If entry
    `i` is `= [u, v]`  (where `0 <= u, v < n`), then there is a directed edge
    from node `u` to node `v`, where `u` consumes the output of `v`.
  * Key `"config_feat"` contains `float32` matrix with shape `(c, 24)` with row
    `j` containing the (graph-level) configuration feature vector (please see
    Subsection "Tile Config Features").
  * Keys `"config_runtime"` and `"config_runtime_normalizers"`: both are `int64`
    vectors of length `c`. Entry `j` stores the runtime (in nanoseconds) of the
    given graph compiled with configuration `j` and a default configuration,
    respectively. Samples from the same graph may have slightly different `"config_runtime_normalizers"` because they are measured from different runs
    on multiple machines.

Finally, for the tile collection, your job is to predict the indices of the best
configurations (i.e., ones leading to the smallest `d["config_runtime"] / d["config_runtime_normalizers"]`).

### Layout Collections `.npz` files

Suppose a `.npz` file stores a graph (representing the entire program) with `n`
nodes and `m` edges. In addition, suppose we compile the graph with `c`
different configurations, and run each on a TPU. **Crucially, the configuration
is at the node-level.**. Suppose that `nc` of the `n` nodes are configurable.
Then, the `.npz` file stores the following dictionary (can be loaded with, e.g.,
`d = dict(np.load("npz/layout/xla/random/train/unet3d.npz"))`):

  * Keys `"node_feat"`, `"node_opcode"`, `"edge_index"`,  are like above.
  * Key `"node_config_ids"` contains `int32` vector with shape `(nc, )` and
    every entry is in `{0, 1, ..., n - 1}` i.e. indicating the indices of the
    configurable nodes. For these nodes, they can have an additional feature
    vector that instructs the compiler (described next).
  * Key `"node_config_feat"` contains `float32` tensor  with shape
    `(c, nc, 18)`. Entry `[j, k]` gives an 18-dimensional vector describing the
    configuration features for node `d["node_config_ids"][k]` for the `j`th run
    (please see Subsection "Layout Config Features", below).
  * Key `"config_runtime"` contains `int32` vector with shape `(c, )` where the
    `j`th entry contains the runtime of the `j`th run (i.e., when nodes are
    configured with `d["node_config_feat"][j]`).

Finally, for the layout collections, your job is to predict sort the indices
from best-to-worse configurations (i.e., ones leading to the smallest
`d["config_runtime"]`). We do not have to use runtime normalizers for this task
because the runtime variation at the entire program level is very small.

Optionally, you may access key `"node_splits"`, which is a variable-length list
of node IDs that are the starting of HLO computations in the graph (similar to
functions in a program). Essentially, nodes `d["node_splits"][i]` to
`d["node_splits"][i+1] - 1` belongs to the same computation. If you want to
partition the graph into multiple segments, this information may be useful,
e.g., putting nodes from the same computation in the same partition. However,
you may compute your own partitioning (e.g., using METIS) as well.


## Features

### Node Features

To extract a node feature vector, we either copy values from various fields in an XLA’s HLO instruction (a node in an HLO graph) as they are, or convert categorical values using one-hot encoding. To convert an unbounded list of numbers (e.g. tensor shape) to a fixed-size vector, we truncate the list to six elements and include the summation and/or product of all elements in the list (e.g., the product of dimension sizes represents the volume of the tensor). In our dataset, none of the tensors has more than six dimensions.

The following describe each element at a particular index in the node feature vector.

```

Suffix _i, where i is an integer, indicates the information for the tensor dimension i. If a tensor has N dimensions, feature values of _i are set to 0 if i >= N (0 padding). Suffix _sum is the summation of the feature values across all dimensions. Suffix _product is the product of the feature values across all dimensions.

The source code of the feature extractor can be found [here](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/tpu_graphs/blob/main/tpu_graphs/process_data/xla/featurizers.h#L542), which extracts features/attributes from HloProto defined [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r2.10/tensorflow/compiler/xla/service/hlo.proto).

### Tile Config Features

The following describe each element at a particular index in the tile config feature vector.

```
// 0–7: Tile sizes of the convolution kernel, only for a convolution operation.
0: kernel_bounds_0
1: kernel_bounds_1
2: kernel_bounds_2
3: kernel_bounds_3
4: kernel_bounds_4
5: kernel_bounds_5
6: kernel_bounds_sum
7: kernel_bounds_product
// 8–15: Output tile sizes.
8: output_bounds_0
9: output_bounds_1
10: output_bounds_2
11: output_bounds_3
12: output_bounds_4
13: output_bounds_5
14: output_bounds_sum
15: output_bounds_product
// 16-23: Input tile sizes.
16: input_bounds_0
17: input_bounds_1
18: input_bounds_2
19: input_bounds_3
20: input_bounds_4
21: input_bounds_5
22: input_bounds_sum
23: input_bounds_product
```

Note that input_bounds are usually set to 0 because they can be inferred by the compiler from output_bounds (and kernel_bounds). If a tensor has N dimensions, feature values of _i are set to 0 if i >= N (0 padding).

### Layout Config Features

The following describe each element at a particular index in the per-node layout config feature vector.

```
// 0–5: Physical layout of the output tensor
0: output_layout_0
1: output_layout_1
2: output_layout_2
3: output_layout_3
4: output_layout_4
5: output_layout_5
// 6-11: Physical layout of the input  tensor
6: input_layout_0
7: input_layout_1
8: input_layout_2
9: input_layout_3
10: input_layout_4
11: input_layout_5
// 12-17: Physical layout of the kernel tensor, only for a convolution operation
12: kernel_layout_0
13: kernel_layout_1
14: kernel_layout_2
15: kernel_layout_3
16: kernel_layout_4
17: kernel_layout_5
```

If a tensor has N dimensions, feature values of _i are set to -1 if i >= N (-1 padding). A layout determines the order of minor-to-major tensor dimensions. For example, the layout of {1, 0, 2, -1, -1, -1} of a 3D tensor indicates that dimension 1 is the most minor (elements of the most minor dimension are consecutive in the physical space) and dimension 2 is the most major. We also include a tensor layout of {-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1} to indicate the compiler to apply its default strategy of selecting the layout for that tensor.


## Graph Feature Extraction

This section explains how to customize the node feature extraction.
The raw graph data is saved in protobuf format, defined as `ModuleTuningData` in
`tpu_graphs/proto/tuning.proto`.
`FeaturizeHloInstruction` in `tpu_graphs/process_data/xla/featurizers.h`
contains the main logic to extract node features from a raw graph.
To customize node feature extraction, you can modify `tpu_graphs/process_data/xla/featurizers.h`
and the corresponding size of the node feature vector defined in
`tpu_graphs/process_data/xla/hlo_opcode.h`.

Then, build the following C++ file to create Python module for extracting graph features:
```
sudo apt install bazel-5.4.1
bazel-5.4.1 build -c opt tpu_graphs/process_data/xla/graph_features.so --experimental_repo_remote_exec
cp bazel-bin/tpu_graphs/process_data/xla/graph_features.so .
```

The function can be used in Python as follows:
```python
import graph_features
node_opcode, node_feat, edge_index, node_config_ids, node_splits = graph_features.extract_graph_features("<path_to_raw_protobuf_data>.pb")
```

The directory structure and filenames of .pb files match those of .npz files.
In particular, the original graph in `npz/.../xxx.npz` can be found in `pb/.../xxx.pb`.
Therefore, you can use graph features produced by this function instead of
(node_opcode, node_feat, edge_index, node_config_ids, node_splits) attributes
from the .npz file.

### Testing in C++

To test that your code is working properly within C++, you can run:
```
bazel-5.4.1 build -c opt tpu_graphs/process_data/xla/data_main --experimental_repo_remote_exec --sandbox_debug --verbose_failures
./bazel-bin/tpu_graphs/process_data/xla/data_main <path_to_raw_protobuf_data>.pb
```

### Troubleshooting

If you get `libstdc++.so.6: version GLIBCXX_3.4.30 not found ` during
`import graph_features`, you can follow these steps.
First, check if you have `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6.0.30`.
If not, install it. Then, fix your conda environment to use that version.
```
cp /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6.0.30 /usr/local/google/home/{user}/miniconda3/envs/tpugraphs/lib/
rm /usr/local/google/home/{user}/miniconda3/envs/tpugraphs/lib/libstdc++.so.6
sudo ln -sf /usr/local/google/home/mangpo/miniconda3/envs/tpugraphs/lib/libstdc++.so.6.0.30 /usr/local/google/home/mangpo/miniconda3/envs/tpugraphs/lib/libstdc++.so.6
```
